The [original game](https://github.com/SunnyNagam/Fadeway) by [Sunny Nagam](https://sunnynagam.github.io/) won 2017's Cobresun Game Jam and was a ton of fun, so Cobresun attempted a more [modern remake](https://github.com/Cobresun/Fadeaway) in 2020 which was good but we didn't pursue further.
I thought it could be fun to take the concept and bring it to multiplayer and this is the result!
